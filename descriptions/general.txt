Due to unfortunate and/or sexual circumstances, you have been deprived of air for extended periods of time. Somehow you have pushed through to survive.
Your body has learned that it may not always be supplied with what it needs. You may survive much longer without oxygen and may store what little you can get for extended periods of time. Apologies for ruining your sex life.

Veteran
You have experienced the shouts and spells of beings completely out of your range of imagination.
You will not survive but at least you won’t be completely immobilized while you get eaten. Good luck warrior.
2nd stage: You are immune to the fear of facing that which you do not understand.  Be wary, some might sense your arrogance in the face of power, others might fear it.
