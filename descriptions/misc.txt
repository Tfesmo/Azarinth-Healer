‘ding’ ‘The Bluemoon Grass has changed your body permanently.
You grow more resilient +10 Vitality.
The flow of your mana was changed +10 Intelligence +10 Wisdom.
You recharge Mana at a faster pace +100% mana recovery rate.’

‘ding’ ‘You have proven to be more resilient and masochistic than few before you, training without ANY regard for your own body or mind in a wide variety of General skills. Mostly Resistances.
To find and acquire these skills is already an achievement worthy of mention. To train them to their maximum potential is far beyond even that.
For reaching level three hundred in at least one class, unlocking thirty General skills and achieving a minimum of 2nd lvl 20 in ten or more General skills, you have unlocked 3rd tier General skill points.’

‘General skills available for third tier advancement:’

- Meditation
You have fought with Meditation active, have trusted in the skill and have consistently used it to its full potential in the midst of battle. It is certainly crafty and yet quite opposite to the actual intention.
Through your complete disregard for such matters, you have unlocked the potential third tier of Meditation.

- Blood Manipulation Resistance
You have faced both the carefully crafted Corruption of the Descent as well as the might of a Starved Vampire. Neither has fazed you, proving that your body is ready to advance Blood Manipulation Resistance to the third tier.

- Heat Resistance
Be it Cliff Wyverns or the power of a Trakorov, you have faced and lived through their smoldering fire. Truly, it is remarkable your path has not lead to fire related classes but here we are. You may advance this skill to the third tier.

- Light Magic Resistance
Not many have witnessed the combined effort of Elder Sun Sprites and even fewer have lived to tell the tale. It is beyond anything the second tier would provide protection against, making you ready for the third tier.

- Wind Resistance
The Storm Griffin is an ancient and proud creature. Your survival is a grave insult and proof enough that you deserve to reach the next tier of Wind Resistance.

- Mental Resistance
You have trained with true masters of mind magic. Human, Mind Weaver and Enavurin. Their expertise has tested your defense and Resistance in ways few could.
Perhaps there is a case to be made if this training hasn’t in the end led to your many resistances in the first place, leaving cracks in your sanity that even you could not heal. Stay safe.

- Corrosion Resistance
You have literally bathed in acid, have chosen to slather yourself in corrosive substances instead of trying to avoid them. It is quite frankly, concerning. Your body has melted and regenerated so many times it might even be second nature by now.
Should you wish to advance your Corrosion Resistance to the third tier, you may do so.

- Poison Resistance
Perhaps it is only natural, for humans to eat and drink things that damage their bodies. When it is alcohol and chili for some, you choose the deadliest poisons carefully crafted and measured by top assassins and predators. Poisons that should kill you twice over. You do you.

- Lightning Resistance
Your need to electrocute yourself makes one think you should have probably chosen to become an electrician instead of going studying. Trades are a good option in today’s economy after all.
Well, here lightning works a little different and while it is certainly admirable that you try to challenge Elementals, you might want to give it another couple centuries. However you have more than proven your capability to advance Lightning Resistance to the third tier.

- Sand Magic Resistance
It’s been like a week. Please slow down with these. A Lightning Elemental and a Sand Elemental. I think it is time to accept that you will not learn. Sand Magic Resistance can be increased to the third tier, should you wish to do so.
Perhaps this skill will help steer you towards a different fate than a certain Chosen One.

- Arcane Magic Resistance
Magic, a force mysterious and powerful. It fuels both deadly spells and incredible creation. You have seen and felt it in its raw and chaotic form. It has coursed through you, has permeated your very core.
Few live through what you have. Not just in general… that too… but just the Arcane itself. The recommendation to visit a psychiatrist is still something you should consider. Really.

- Space Magic Resistance
Against all common sense you have not just faced an Ascended in battle, you have invited a Fae to travel and train with you. In the face of meeting the most powerful being your weak human self could not even comprehend, you remain mostly unfazed.
To ask the true Fae to train you is not just an insult, it is lunacy. And yet it seems the creature somehow has come to like you. Truly, incomprehensible.

- Lava Magic Resistance
You trained with a Trakorov. Why?
