Arcane Magic Resistance
Wielding the true arcane is a rare and powerful talent only accessible to few.
The raw energies tear at not just flesh and bone but at the magical structure and minds of whomever faces them.
Its red glow turns purple the more refined it is.
This skill shall help you counter masters of the arcane.
2nd stage: Your flow of mana has been ruptured many times by the raw form of magic, making it substantially more resistant to both adept mages and natural occurrences of the true arcane.

Ash Magic Resistance
You have found a being similar to your own, wielding magic you are not just familiar with but have mastered.
A small increase in your resistance but perhaps a new insight into your own connection to Ash itself.

Blast Resistance
Explosions can be an unpredictable and chaotic thing.
You have survived quite an impressive one to get this skill.
It will help you negate the damage ever so slightly for the next time you chose to stand in one.
2nd stage: Despite common sense, you just keep on doing it. Either you should start reading safety manuals or embrace that you are a true explosion elemental.
Your organs, bones, muscles and your skin become partially shock absorbent. Please stop.

Blood Magic Resistance
The arts of blood manipulation can be deceptive and dangerous to both ally and foe.
You have stood against the old magic and lived. Next time your chance of survival will be even higher.
2nd stage: Masters of this ancient art have found ways to use the very essence of your life against you.
With sheer ferocity, you have shown that not every creature born of blood is prey alone.
They will find it a challenge to invade and use what belongs to you alone.

Blood Manipulation Resistance
A rare gift similar to poisons having an effect with dangerous results.
Your blood was tampered with through magic but you have survived, making it harder for the next attempt by your enemy.
2nd stage: Stop putting weird substances you find into open wounds.
Perhaps your parents told you that playing in dirt was good for your immune system but there are limits. Your body can now fight blood manipulation actively.

Corrosion Resistance
Many substances can be corrosive.
Even the strongest stone will be cut through by the right combination of chemicals.
You have been exposed to more corrosion than many others and with this skill your resistance to many substances will be heightened.
2nd stage: Your insatiable need to melt and dissolve your body has changed its structure significantly.
Your very cells have become more resistant to change and imbalance.

Crystal Resistance
Crystals aren’t just shiny decorations to old ruins and caves.
You have learned that the arcane scholars have found ways to turn the beautiful natural phenomenon into something quite more deadly.
Less deadly to you with this skill.
2nd stage: Your body adapts, crystal growth and transmutation now exponentially harder to achieve on your tissue.

Curse Resistance
Curses are seldom cast and even more seldom survived.
You are one of few individuals to tell the tale.
Not a pleasant one to be sure but with this skill you might be able to survive it again should the need arise.

Dark Magic Resistance
You have stood against a being of true darkness.
Its magic was not able to pierce your defenses and you stand to tell the tale.
This skill will help you repeat such actions.

Death Magic Resistance
Common in the deepest and most depraved parts of the world, the magic of death itself seeks nothing but to destroy, to rot and kill.
It is difficult to survive but to someone like you, what is death but another challenge?
2nd stage: Necromancers, Blood, and Death mages hate you.
Your blood, bones and your body are mostly unusable in their rituals.

Dust Magic Resistance
Dangerous and elusive magic answering to few who seek its complexity, understand its beauty.
You have faced a mage of dust and lived, preparing you for the next confrontation, should it come to pass.

Earth Magic Resistance
The earth trembles as arcane beings bend its nature to their will.
You have found stone and earth to be a worthwhile opponent yet stood unmoving in its destructive path.
This skill will help you negate more of its damage.
2nd stage: Your skin and bones harden, adapting more and more to the element that threatened your life again and again.

Fear Resistance
You have overcome something truly terrifying to you.
Your ability to deal with non magical fear is increased.

Gravity Magic Resistance
A force of nature, bound and warped my magic itself.
Perhaps not noticing the damage dealt to your body, you have developed a way to resist this magic.
2nd stage: You remain firmly planted and understand a little of the intricacies of gravity.
A more practical sense that allows you to move in varied gravity with less difficulty.  Be it magical or otherwise.

Health Drain Resistance
Some creatures have the ability to drain your health.
You have been subjected to such a spell and have endured.
This skill will help you endure more easily and turn the tables on your enemies.
2nd stage: Your health is yours, with each point lost it will become more difficult to steal from you what is yours alone.

Heat Resistance
Ignoring the warnings of your parents and friends, you refuse to not stand in fire. 
This skill will help lessen the damage and pain a little.
2nd stage: You’ve been burnt and melted again and again.
Through extreme exposure, your skin, muscles and bones become much harder to burn and melt.
3rd stage: It is a mystery how the soul of a literal Volcano has found its way into your body, forcing you to seek out fire and heat as much as you do. Do you not see how melting your body is not a good idea?
The third tier lets you retain and use some of the flames and heat around you, should you choose to do so. They are still damaging of course but it seems you are beyond caring.

Ice Resistance
You have endured the biting cold of ice and lived to tell the tale.
One of the deadliest climates and magics will now be less dangerous to you with this skill.
2nd stage: Freezing temperatures no longer affect your body. It is not advised to jump in front of flying ice lances or to anger the spirits.

Lava Magic Resistance
An elemental form of molten rock, reserved for those few living in conditions most consider deadly.
You have met and fought such a being, its magic opposed by Heat and Earth magic resistance but ultimately something different, more primordial and ancient.

Light Magic Resistance
The power of the sun harnessed and enhanced by magic.
You have experienced the burning heat of light and pushed ahead. This skill will help you be more resistant.
2nd stage: Staring into the light should have really blinded you at this point. Instead, you have gotten used to it. 
Your eyes are much less sensitive to the negative effects associated with light. You are mostly immune to sudden blinding changes, be they an abrupt abundance or lack of light.

Lightning Resistance
Either in a storm or fighting a ferocious beast blessed by lightning you have resisted. This skill will help further with your endeavors.
2nd stage: You are so familiar with Lightning that your body can transform a fraction of the energy into Mana and Stamina.

Mana Drain Resistance
Rare foes will have the ability to drain your mana.
Either for their own use or simply to weaken you.
Having encountered one such being, you have learned of its destructive effect.
This skill will help you reduce the effect any mana draining abilities will have on you.
2nd stage: Your mana is bound to you, making it harder for anybody to drain it from you.
In addition the mana removed from you damages the enemy, should they desire to use it for themselves.
This effect increases with every point of mana lost.

Mental Resistance
You are more adept at resisting and detecting attacks to your mind.
2nd stage: Your mind is nearly impenetrable. Attacks on your mind will be partially reflected, causing harm to the attacker.
3rd stage: Your mind is a bright shield and warning to anyone that dares attack it. You can pin point attackers and gain a general idea of their mind magic capabilities.
You gain the capability to initiate mental contact with those that are receptive, sending simple thoughts and feelings.

Mist Magic Resistance
Mist magic is a rare talent, found in students of the arcane adept in both wind and water magic.
It is an elusive power, difficult to wield yet ultimately destructive and impossible to avoid.
You have faced it and lived. This skill will help you do so again.
2nd stage: Through increasing exposure you have learned to stop the elusive mist from passing through you.

Obsidian Magic Resistance
A rare form of steel manipulation requiring a strong mind and an abundance of Obsidian.
Like many obscure schools of magic, its powers are varied and flexible, molded by their masters.
Your body has suffered heavy damage from such magic, making it a little more resistant.

Pain Tolerance
Being a bit of a masochist, you have learned to ignore some of the pain.
No, only physical pain.
You’re feeling a little more numb towards pain but careful...the damage is still being done!
2nd stage: You’ve been through more pain than most others.
You are now able to completely turn off your perception of pain.
Be wary as there is a reason pain exists.

Poison Resistance
You are a target of assassins or not very good at distinguishing berries.
Surviving either of those you have developed a general resistance to poisons.
2nd stage: Either you need better guards or you need to stop eating everything you see.
Experience has granted you an ability to sense poison. Additionally its spread throughout your body is slower, reducing its effects.
3rd stage: Your favorite drink and seasoning for every food, you revel in that which destroys you. No more.
You may neutralize the effects of many poisons on touch, in a mug of ale, your body, or someone else’s with the help of mana intrusion abilities, should you choose to do so.

Sand Magic Resistance
A powerful and versatile school of magic, able to slash, crush and suffocate. Usually found and common in certain desert regions, its masters unchallenged within their domain.
Exposure has made you more resilient to this type of magic.
2nd stage: Through exposure and forced understanding, you will find it easier to move through sand.
An ability most sand mages and creatures master early in their development and one of their core advantages.

Silver Magic Resistance
A rare magic to be sure and just as deadly.
Not quite corrosion or poison, silver magic can be devious, its effects complex.
You have survived and are one of few who have been exposed and lived.

Soul Magic Resistance
The fleeting conscience of man and beast. Flesh, energy, motion and thought.
The Soul stands separate entirely, yet intertwined all the same.
Through hardship you have learned understanding, not through meditation and study.
A brutal yet comforting truth, strengthening that which cannot be grasped.

Sound Magic Resistance
Intricate and difficult to master, used by both mages and monsters. You have withstood and survived sound attacks, making you more resistant to its effects.

Space Magic Resistance
Most who try to chase this elusive school of magic will find and choose the Void instead.
You have fought a being of truly peculiar making, have faced and survived its spells and may count yourself amongst the few to call this skill their own.
2nd stage: A true mystery, how you have sustained so much damage through Space Magic. You must have truly angered a being to summon such scorn. Your body and its parts become more difficult to displace.

Stamina Drain Resistance
The more rarely used drain magic focused on Stamina.
It’s effects are not as immediately noticeable as Health or Mana drain skills but the end result is just as devastating.
You have learned to resist such spells to an extent.
2nd stage: Stamina exhaustion won’t impact you as heavily anymore as it did previously.
Your body is used to rapid magical Stamina Drain and can counteract its absence through mana and health respectively.

Time Magic Resistance
The intricacies of time magic are difficult to grasp, its secrets hidden forever to most who attempt the plunge.
A rare few have managed to bend the elusive force to their will, making it a dangerous tool both for themselves and for their enemies.
2nd stage: While it certainly eludes your simple mind, your body has learned that the flows and waves of time are fickle. 
Bent and shrouded for too many times, you have found a center in it all. A calm in the sea of time. It will take a true master to disturb what you have found to be truth.

Void Magic Resistance
The mystical magic usually used to enchant high level items applied as a form of combat magic.
It’s as deadly as it is silent. How exactly you survived is unclear, perhaps the caster willed it so.
Next time it might work against a true enemy as well.

Water Resistance
In your days you have learned many things.
One of them is that water pressure is not a joke.
This Resistance helps a little with reducing the damage.
2nd stage: You’ve taken so much damage from water based attacks it might be good to check if you’re not actually on fire.
Getting more used to it your body and armor magically redirects the pressure to lessen the burden on you.

Wind Resistance
The ever elusive magic of Wind can cut from any side.
You have learned that it might’ve been a good idea to become a Void mage.
This skill helps you resist the power of wind a little more.
2nd stage: The mana flow inside of you has acclimated itself to the air around you, making you more aerodynamic.

Wood Magic Resistance
A connection made from a mage to nature allowed for this talent to take root.
Facing the force of nature you grow more accustomed to its effects, your body more resilient to the magic of the forest.
2nd stage: Magic of life and nature. It is concerning how much you have enraged the usually peaceful creatures and mages using this school.
Through painfully learned understanding, your body can now absorb a fraction of the life used.
