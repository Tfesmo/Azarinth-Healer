	- strength of a spell can be improved by Strength stat in some cases.
	- lvl 8 Blink - 15 mana
	- higher level skills = cheaper

Chapter 202

	- Strength/Dexterity less important than Intelligence, but still critical for movement/hitting.

Chapter 253
	- Per Terok (OG mecha-dwarf)
	- 300 is always an evolution.  Rare examples @ 111, 250.

Chapter 278
	- From Maro:
	- Vit/Wis most important
	- Recommends not leaving Str/Dex behind completely for Int
	- Has skills that boost Int and End
	- Muses on 3rd tier skill requirements
	- Illea:
	- Notes Int boosts all magic, auras, creation, manipulation, and mana intrusion.  Unsure how it benefits auras since those have explicit numbers?
	- Effectively everything but raw physical damage and healing.

Chapter 284
	- On Vitality/health and the effect on damage:
	"While the Taleen metal wasn’t anything special according to the smiths she had met, she still didn’t manage to majorly dent it with each punch.
	Perhaps it was the way they forged it or something related to the machine itself.
	If her own body and ash was anything to go by then perhaps the metal was considered their body and only once their Vitality reached a certain threshold, it would get majorly damaged."

Chapter 285
	- Illea notes that her Ashen Warrior bonus (Damage inflicted with your own body and while shrouded in Ash is 70% [350%] higher) impacts at least her mana intrusion abilities.
	- Likely impacts all spells but not confirmed?

Chapter 298
	- "She saw the difference her Strength brought, each hit crashing into her enemies with a devastating force."
	- "Dexterity changed her ability to dodge, use openings to her advantage and to simply have her body keep up with her perception."
	- "Intelligence boosted the damage from her spells, all three of these stats letting her win against her enemies in the first place."

Chapter 327
	- Maro, responding to Illea asking about Ashen Magic Resistance:
	- "Still, having the class makes you more resilient to it than any resistance skill could ever achieve."

Chapter 438
	- Conversation with Fae Gestalt, all chapters around this are useful.
	- "A certain level of Vitality is necessary to stop aging in humans. Two hundred is usually around the point where it slows down so much that your perception coupled with the way you experience the flow of time leads to the illusion that people do not age."
