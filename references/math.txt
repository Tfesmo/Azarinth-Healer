Chapter 9
	- 1% natural, 1% bluemoon.  Wisdom adds 0.1% per 10 points, 80 Wisdom = 2.8% max mana per minute.
	
Chapter 37
	- Illea fights Aliana and is severely hurt.  Text says she takes an impressive seven minutes to heal.
	- She has 1600 health at this point.  In seven minutes her natural health regen will recover 254 health.
	- That means Restoration @2-13 is restoring a maximum average of 3.2 health per second over those seven minutes.

Chapter 42
	- Takes poison for 25/s, comments that it's nothing compared to Reconstruction
	- Either author error or mana limitations to explain inconsistency with Chapter 37 above
	- EDIT: Likely that this is from the Chapter 50 stuff where body damage takes longer

Chapter 47
	- Blink @2-20 is ~10 mana per activation

Chapter  50
	- Foot chopped off, is 15% health lost.  Takes 15 minutes to regrow.  Reduced effectiveness on certain damage, or mana needs to be spent regrowing?
	- Later takes 89% from Centurion explosion, 10 minutes to heal the worst of the damage, another 10 to stabalize.  Health goes up by less than 10% during these 20 minutes.
	- Additional after this to regrow all limbs.  Safe to conclude rebuilding body costs additional mana on top of health?

	- Indicates it takes six minutes to refill mana, current calculations with Meditation should refill in less than five.  Math error somewhere.

Chapter 184
	- Recovery is at least 50 hp/sec based on poison testing.
	- Illea notes certain injuries take longer based on her expertise.

Chapter 231
	- Illea sacrifices 500 health with the knowledge she can heal it back in less than 2 seconds
	- Floor on Restoration of 250 hp/sec
	- EDIT: 250 is too high, see Chapter 273 notes.  Not sure why Illea sacrificed that much when facing a dangerous blow.  Resilience boost more valuable than the health lost?

Chapter 266
	- 3rd tier Restoration (@3-1, +100% healing bonus) stores ~3.1k for "nearly one and a half thousand" mana
	- Speculation: 1550/1476 is almost exactly 5%
	- This would give her 3rd tier restoration a formula of 1:1 mana:hp, plus 5% additional hp per level in the 3rd tier, then multiplied by her healing bonus
	- Depending on rounding and how close "nearly" means, this could go as low as 2% per additional level based on available evidence, assuming the growth is linear at all

Chapter 273
	- While poison testing Illea pegs her Hunter Restoration @3-2 at right around 60 hp/sec
	- Notes that Hunter Recovery is nearly double over Restoration

Chapter 302
	- Illea notes that going from +100% to +200% Healing Magic bonus doubles her healing (to 150/sec).
	- Should be a 50% increase (3/2).  Math error?  She was at 60/sec in previous note, so could also be from the evolution as skill changed.
