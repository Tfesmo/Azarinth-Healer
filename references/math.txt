Chapter 9
	- 1% natural, 1% bluemoon.  Wisdom adds 0.1% per 10 points, 80 Wisdom = 2.8% max mana per minute.
	
Chapter 37
	- Illea fights Aliana and is severely hurt.  Text says she takes an impressive seven minutes to heal.
	- She has 1600 health at this point.  In seven minutes her natural health regen will recover 254 health.
	- That means Restoration @2-13 is restoring a maximum average of 3.2 health per second over those seven minutes.

Chapter 42
	- Takes poison for 25/s, comments that it's nothing compared to Reconstruction
	- Either author error or mana limitations to explain inconsistency with Chapter 37 above
	- EDIT: Likely that this is from the Chapter 50 stuff where body damage takes longer

Chapter 47
	- Blink @2-20 is ~10 mana per activation

Chapter  50
	- Foot chopped off, is 15% health lost.  Takes 15 minutes to regrow.  Reduced effectiveness on certain damage, or mana needs to be spent regrowing?
	- Later takes 89% from Centurion explosion, 10 minutes to heal the worst of the damage, another 10 to stabalize.  Health goes up by less than 10% during these 20 minutes.
	- Additional after this to regrow all limbs.  Safe to conclude rebuilding body costs additional mana on top of health?

	- Indicates it takes six minutes to refill mana, current calculations with Meditation should refill in less than five.  Math error somewhere.

Chapter 184
	- Recovery is at least 50 hp/sec based on poison testing.
	- Illea notes certain injuries take longer based on her expertise.

Chapter 231
	- Illea sacrifices 500 health with the knowledge she can heal it back in less than 2 seconds
	- Floor on Restoration of 250 hp/sec
	- EDIT: 250 is too high, see Chapter 273 notes.  Not sure why Illea sacrificed that much when facing a dangerous blow.  Resilience boost more valuable than the health lost?

Chapter 266
	- 3rd tier Restoration (@3-1, +100% healing bonus) stores ~3.1k for "nearly one and a half thousand" mana
	- Speculation: 1550/1476 is almost exactly 5%
	- This would give her 3rd tier restoration a formula of 1:1 mana:hp, plus 5% additional hp per level in the 3rd tier, then multiplied by her healing bonus
	- Depending on rounding and how close "nearly" means, this could go as low as 2% per additional level based on available evidence, assuming the growth is linear at all

Chapter 273
	- While poison testing Illea pegs her Hunter Restoration @3-2 at right around 60 hp/sec
	- Notes that Hunter Recovery is nearly double over Restoration

Chapter 302
	- Illea notes that going from +100% to +200% Healing Magic bonus doubles her healing (to 150/sec).
	- Should be a 50% increase (3/2).  Math error?  She was at 60/sec in previous note, so could also be from the evolution as skill changed.

Chapter 331
	- Illea on the 25% mana reduction from 3rd stage Sentinel Core:
	- "Wait, with twenty five percent reduction… I can heal myself constantly now, without losing mana. As long as meditation is up at least."
	- Her mp/sec with Meditation should be a bit over 50.  This puts the cost of her normal Sentinel Restoration at around ~55-65 mp/sec before Sentinel Core.
	- Possible my math on regen is incorrect, as that seems very high for the healing involved given that it's supposed to be more efficient than 3rd tier.

Chapter 339
	- "What’s your lightning resistance at?” Trian asked, lightning flowing over his arm.
	- “Second tier, level six.” She replied.
	- “I believe it was around ten percent absorption at level one for the resistance, probably up to thirteen percent then with your level.
	  I tested Claire and it varied between one percent and ten at level one, depending on… well we didn’t really find a definitive answer.”

	- Ilea nodded, sacrificing two thousand health before healing herself back instantly. “Alright, I’m down around seven hundred mana. Hit me.”
	- This is @3-16 for Sentinel Restoration.
	- 2000/700 is right in line with the same healing she had @3-1, plus the 50% boost from additional healing from her evolution.
	- Math error or no scaling?

	- Sentinel Core:
	- 10% + 1% per level of resistance in mana absorbtion, per Trian

Chapter 390
	- Illea notes that a -100 hp/sec poison reduces her healing by nearly half, so it should be around 200/sec.

Chapter 396
	- Natural health regen should be 1.1%, not 1%
	- Lots of math/testing at the start of this chapter but no strong conclusions
	- w/Lucas:
	- "level determines a reduction in damage. A percentage. This can vary greatly however, depending on what level the enemy skill used possesses. So, even if you have a high level light magic resistance, my spell being in the third tier will still do significant damage"
	- "The bonuses, I believe it was around forty percent at level twenty and I think eighty at the end of the second tier. I personally don’t have a resistance at that level but I’ve tested plenty. If the progression continues to be linear, it will be eighty percent"
	- "I believe the skill levels add or retract one percent respectively, depending if your resistance is higher or lower than the skill attacking you"
	- Lvl 1=5%, 2=6%, 3=7%, 4=8%, then 2% per level after

Chapter 402
	- Illea pegs her mana reg @ 8/sec without Med.
	- Currently unable to reconcile this with the original formulas from Chapter 9
	- Meditation “nearly doubles” basic mana regen.
	- Changing formula so Meditation only impacts the base 2% makes this work out (9.75%/min without, 18.15%/min with)

Chapter 405
	- Enavurin on resistances:
	- 1-1 =5%
	- 1-10=10%
	- 1-20=20%
	- 2-1 =26%
	- 2-20=45%
	- Cap is 95%
	- Speculation:
	- 3-1 =51%+
	- 3-30=80% - follows the progression but seems too high to be reasonable.

Chapter 409
	- Illea notes Sentinel Reconstruction @3-21 is 324 hp/sec for 4 mp/sec.
	- Doesn't really match previous numbers but this is explicit so takes priority.

Chapter 412
	- mp/sec w/Med should be ~14, based on Fae draining 20 and the remainder being 6.

Chapter 426
	- Meditation 3rd tier, Wisdom doubled:
	- "The bonus to Wisdom alone increased her mana per minute from 4.5% to 9%, doubling again thanks to her maximum mana doubling from 9050 to 18’000.
	- Around 33 per second without Meditation and nearly 46 per second with the skill."
	- Was able to get formulas that match 33/46 pretty well

Chapter 427
	- "The hundred and thirty percent to the potential density of her ash was huge compared to another five percent to her already insanely inflated resilience."
	- Based on this, can probably assume all bonuses are additive.
