Theoretical calculation of effective health, just to show a reference as Illea grows.

Assumes damage is calculated by:
1/(1 + Bonus)

Examples:
100% Resilience: 1/(1 + 100%) = 50% damage taken
200% Resilience: 1/(1 + 200%) = 33.3% damage taken

The total on the stat page is calculated based on half physical, half magical.

Ignores resistances (as they apply inconsistently), and non-numeric bonuses such as density increases.

Example Calculation:
1000 health
+300% resil (4x)
+100% magic resistance (2x)
+100% durability (2x)

Assumes you take all bonuses and add them to gether, then do the 1/(1 + total)
Example Calculation:
1000 health
+300% resil (4x)
+100% magic resistance (2x)
+100% durability (2x)

With the above calucation would +500% total, so a 6x multiplier on EH for magical, 5x on physical, 5500 balanced EH.

Based on chapter 427, Additive is more likely to be accurate.

Mitigation:
This is just a breakdown of part of the EH calculation to better show the difference between extra health and actually taking less damage.

For example:
90.0% [hp x 10]
Means her resisilience + all other bonuses (magic, physical, durability, etc) reduces her total damage taken by 90%, which makes each point of health worth 10.

95.0% [hp x 20]
Means a 95% reduction, or a 20x health multiplier.
