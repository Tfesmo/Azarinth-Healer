Chapter 190ish - just over a year.  Trian revenge plot.
Chapter 279 - nearly two years.  Chatting with Maro about Earth.
Chapter 295 - 2.5 years, give or a take a month.  Just before the final Tremor push to 300.
Chapter 608 - nearly two years since the Arthur Redleaf hunt/kill.  Should be between 3-4 years on Elos total.
